## About Me
I'm a research assistant of the <a href="https://slablab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Speech, Learning, and the Brain (SLaB) Lab</a> at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qinzhenquentin/" target="_blank">Zhen QIN</a>. Before joining the <a href="https://slablab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">SLaB Lab</a>, I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hao-Zhang-39" target="_blank">Hao ZHANG</a> for my undergraduate studies. I'm interested in experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics. Currently, I am mainly involved in an eye-tracking study examining L2 learners' perceptual learning and consolidation of English lexical stress.

## Education

[2023.07-2024.05] **Perception-Production Links in Mandarin Speakers' English Vowels: A Behavioral and Eye-tracking Study**<br>
- Conducted thorough literature review.
- Synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli using MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Designed eye-tracking experiments with <a href="https://www.sr-research.com/experiment-builder/" target="_blank">Experiment Builder</a>. 
- Recruited and conducted eye-tracking experiments with 60 college students.
- Employed automatic annotation for production data using <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/index" target="_blank">DARLA</a>, and automatic extraction of F1 and F2 values in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).
- Calculated participants' boundary width in Python to assess perception performance.
- Processed eye-movement data in R (<a href="http://www.eyetracking-r.com/" target="_blank">eyetrackingR</a>) and calculated the difference between the empirical log-transformed proportions of target and competitor fixations.
- Calculated participants' Pillai score in R to measure vowel overlap and plotted vowel overlap using F1 and F2 values in R (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>).
- Conducted LME and Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) in R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>).



[2023.03-06] **Music Experience Enhances Categorical Perception of English Vowels in Mandarin Speakers**
- Conducted literature review, synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli using MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Recruited 24 college students for participation.
- Designed and executed experiments in <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/" target="_blank">Psychopy</a>.
- Performed ANOVA and Pearson correlation analysis in Python (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pandas/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>).
- Wrote the manuscript.

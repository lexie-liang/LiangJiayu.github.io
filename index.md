## About Me
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in English Language and Literature at Shandong University, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hao-Zhang-39" target="_blank"> Hao Zhang</a>. My research areas include experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics.
For my undergraduate thesis, I employed behavioral and eye-tracking methodologies to investigate the impact of musical experience on the production and perception of English vowels among Mandarin-speaking second language learners. Recently, I started studying the efficacy of musical training and sleep-mediated memory consolidation in facilitating the acquisition of Cantonese level tones, particularly examining their influence on speakers of tonal languages like Mandarin as well as non-tonal languages such as English and Korean.



## Research Interests
- Production and Perception of Non-native Language
- Cross-domain Transfer Effects between Music and Language Experience
- Age-related Differences in Language Learning

## Research Experience
[2024-present] <strong>Efficacy of Melodic Training and Sleep-mediated Memory Consolidation in Learning Cantonese Level Tones by Native Speakers of Mandarin and English</strong><br>
- Conducted extensive literature review.
- Currently leading efforts to recruit 120 college students, comprising 60 Mandarin speakers and 60 English speakers, to engage in the <a href="#melodicTraining2023">music training program and associated assessments,</a> developed in the previous study.







[2023-2024] <strong>Benefits of Melodic Training on the Production and Perception of Cantonese Level Tones by Korean and Chinese Older Adults</strong> <br>
<ul>
    <li>Conducted comprehensive literature review.</li>
    <li id="melodicTraining2023">Developed and implemented a Melodic Height Identification Training program and associated assessments, utilizing JavaScript (<a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych</a>).</li>
    <li>Recruited 30 participants, including 15 Korean and 15 Chinese older adults.</li>
    <li>Employed <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Montreal Forced Aligner</a> for automatic annotation of production data, and MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>) for automatic extraction of F0 values.</li>
    <li>Analyzed participants' tone differentiability and hit rate to evaluate production performance and generated tone overlap plots.</li>
    <li>Transformed perception data (accuracy percentages) into rationalized arcsine units (RAUs) for statistical analysis.</li>
    <li>Conducted Linear Mixed Effects (LME) analysis using R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>) to examine the effects of melodic training on Cantonese level tones perception and production.</li>

[2023-2024] **Perception-Production Links in Mandarin Speakers' English Vowels: A Behavioral and Eye-tracking Study**<br>
- Conducted thorough literature review.
- Synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli using MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Designed eye-tracking experimenst with <a href="https://www.sr-research.com/experiment-builder/" target="_blank">Experiment Builder</a>. 
- Recruited 50 college students for participation.
- Employed automatic annotation for production data using <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/index" target="_blank">DARLA</a>, and automatic extraction of F1 and F2 values in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).
- Calculated participants' boundary width in Python to assess perception performance.
- Processed eye-movement data in R (<a href="http://www.eyetracking-r.com/" target="_blank">eyetrackingR</a>) and calculated the difference between the empirical logtransformed proportions of target and competitor fixations.
- Calculated participants' Pillai score in R to measure vowel overlap and plotted vowel overlap using F1 and F2 values in R (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>)
- Conducted LME and Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) in R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>)

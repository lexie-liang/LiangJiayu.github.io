## About Me
I'm a research assistant in the <a href="https://slab-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">Speech, Learning, and the Brain (SLaB) Lab</a> at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qinzhenquentin/" target="_blank">Quentin Zhen QIN</a>. Before joining the lab, I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hao-Zhang-39" target="_blank">Hao ZHANG</a> for my undergraduate studies. I'm interested in experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics.

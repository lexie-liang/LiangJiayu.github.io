## About Me
I'm a research assistant of the <a href="https://slablab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Speech, Learning, and the Brain (SLaB) Lab</a> at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qinzhenquentin/" target="_blank">Zhen QIN</a>. I'm interested in experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics. My current research uses psycholinguistic methods to examine how English lexical stress is perceptually learned and consolidated by second-language learners.

## Education

## Research Experience
[2024-present] <strong>Efficacy of Melodic Training and Sleep-mediated Memory Consolidation in Learning Cantonese Level Tones by Native Speakers of Mandarin and Korean</strong><br>
- Conducted extensive literature review.
- Recruited 80 Mandarin-speaking college students to engage in the <a href="#melodicTraining2023">music training program and associated assessments,</a> developed in the previous study.







[2023-2024] <strong>Benefits of Melodic Training on the Production and Perception of Cantonese Level Tones by Korean and Chinese Older Adults</strong> <br>
<ul>
    <li>Conducted comprehensive literature review.</li>
    <li id="melodicTraining2023">Developed and implemented a Melodic Height Identification Training program and associated assessments (identification and discrimination tests), utilizing JavaScript (<a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych</a>).</li>
    <li>Recruited 30 participants, including 15 Korean and 15 Chinese older adults.</li>
    <li>Employed <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Montreal Forced Aligner</a> for automatic annotation of production data, and MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>) for automatic extraction of F0 values.</li>
    <li>Analyzed participants' tone differentiability and hit rate to evaluate production performance and generated tone overlap plots.</li>
    <li>Transformed perception data (accuracy percentages) into rationalized arcsine units (RAUs) for statistical analysis.</li>
    <li>Conducted Linear Mixed Effects (LME) analysis using R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>) to examine the effects of melodic training on Cantonese level tones perception and production.</li>
</ul>





[2023-2024] **Perception-Production Links in Mandarin Speakers' English Vowels: A Behavioral and Eye-tracking Study**<br>
- Conducted thorough literature review.
- Synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli using MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Designed eye-tracking experiments with <a href="https://www.sr-research.com/experiment-builder/" target="_blank">Experiment Builder</a>. 
- Recruited 60 college students for participation.
- Employed automatic annotation for production data using <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/index" target="_blank">DARLA</a>, and automatic extraction of F1 and F2 values in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).
- Calculated participants' boundary width in Python to assess perception performance.
- Processed eye-movement data in R (<a href="http://www.eyetracking-r.com/" target="_blank">eyetrackingR</a>) and calculated the difference between the empirical log-transformed proportions of target and competitor fixations.
- Calculated participants' Pillai score in R to measure vowel overlap and plotted vowel overlap using F1 and F2 values in R (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>).
- Conducted LME and Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) in R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>).



[2023] **Music Experience Enhances Categorical Perception of English Vowels in Mandarin Speakers**
- Conducted literature review, synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli using MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Recruited 24 college students for participation.
- Designed and executed experiments in <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/" target="_blank">Psychopy</a>.
- Performed ANOVA and Pearson correlation analysis in Python (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pandas/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>).
- Wrote the manuscript.
